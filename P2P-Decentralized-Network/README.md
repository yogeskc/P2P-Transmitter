# P2P Decentralized Network with BitTorrent Protocol

# Project Guidelines 

Please refer  (P2P.pdf)  for detailed guidelines to run this project.

# The Tit-For-Tat Transfer Protocol

This P2P program is implement the Tit-For-Tat transfer protocol. This protocol only allows a peer to be downloading/uploading
data from/to a maximum of four other peers or seeders; the top three with maximum upload rate, and a a random chosen peer. 
The goal of connecting to a random peer/seeder is to increment the participation of rarest peers in the network. This situation
must be reevaluated every 30 seconds because peers disconnect and connect all the time during the sharing process. 

See P2P.pdf for more info about how to compute temporal upload and downloads rates. 

# HTPBS for Showing Pieces Downloading/Uploading Progresses 

In order to show the progress of the pieces your peer is uploading or downloading to/from the P2P network,  the htpbs (horizontal threaded progress bars) library is used. This library tracks the progress of threaded jobs and is customizable to for your project. Exactly what you need for this project!. For more info about this library: https://pypi.org/project/htpbs/

### Install with PIP

```python 
pip3 install htpbs
